# Readers-Writers-Problem
Simply we give to this project the number of peers,which are going to read or write of Num_Of_Entries Entries and this process will be repeated for Iteration_Times. We can control readers-writers from Ratio(Readers-Writers). After execution we can observe what happened in each Entry (number of times that have been read or written and average waiting time). Finally, we display number of (reading and writing) times of all peers and all entries, so as to check if everything went fine.
In this project
